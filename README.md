  <h3> Overview </h3>
  <h4> Description </h4>
  <p> Provides suggested venues and/or activities for dates based on the user's preferences, <br>budget, and how long they've been seeing their date. </p>
  
  <h3> App Evaluation </h3>
  <p> <strong> Category: </strong> Social Networking </p>
  <p> <strong> Story:  </strong>Analyzes user's preferences of social outings from a series of questions, and connects them with several things to do within their area. The user can then decide     where to go based on the top 5 sugestions generated and save the others for later dates. </p>
  <p> <strong> Market: </strong> For safety reasons and for the sake of age restrictions, the app will be designated for 21+ users. </p>
  <p> <strong> Habit: </strong> This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly theyâ€™re         looking for. </p>
  <p> <strong> Scope: </strong> To start, the app would suggest activities within a 50 square mile radius, then it could potentially branch out from there.<br>
      Large potential for use with actual dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble etc.</p>
